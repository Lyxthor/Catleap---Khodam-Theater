Steps for using this project's assets in your editor :
1. Create a blank project in Unity 2D built in Renderer Pipeline template. (Using Editor version 2021.3.21f1 is recommended)
2. Delete all files in assets folder.
3. Init new github folder in Assets folder.
4. Pull this project into your assets folder.
5. And all should've done (probably).
